	/**
	 * This is a patch against ReSID
	 *         engine in libsidplay2-2.1.1 to make its sound closer to 6581R4
	 *         chip.<BR>
	 * 
	 * http://bel.fi/~alankila/c64-sw/
	 * 
	 * <P>
	 * <B>Good simulation of strong lead and bass distortion.</B> Tel's leads,
	 * Jeff's bass, Mechanicus's extreme distortion: it all seems to reproduce
	 * quite nicely.
	 * 
	 * <P>
	 * <B>Good simulation of advanced effects peculiar to 6581</B>, especially
	 * on Jeff's songs that target 6581R4.
	 * 
	 * <P>
	 * <B>Parameters are now in sidplay2.ini file.</B> No recompile is
	 * necessary when testing alternative parameters.
	 * 
	 * <P>
	 * <B>Bugs in some songs, especially related to lowpass filter output.</B>
	 * The middle part of Spaceman Salutes Commodore and intro for Snake Disco
	 * are incorrectly rendered. (ReSID's linear filter is totally wrong with
	 * them too.) Vendetta probably gets too much edge in the bass, too. It
	 * seems that some kind of additional low-pass filtering needs to happen
	 * during so far unknown filter conditions.
	 * <P>
	 * <UL>
	 * <LI> 8.12.2007 Separate parameters for band-pass (high) and low-pass
	 * (low) distortion. This doubles the number of tunables, but seems like a
	 * necessary step to open experimentation on this front.
	 * <LI> 6.12.2007 New distortion algorithm. After I scratched the whole
	 * model of substracting filter states from each other. The new model simply
	 * calculates distortion by mixing in the filter state terms and input in
	 * linear combination. The following rules seem to apply:
	 * <OL>
	 * <LI> Vlp term must be about 0.9. More than that, and Jeff's bass sounds
	 * lose their edge. Too little, and pretty much everything distorts wrong.
	 * <LI> Vbp term be something negative like -0.5 or -1 or Vendetta and
	 * Meanwhile The Planet doesn't work.
	 * <LI> Vhp must be small or the distortion loses its "edge".
	 * </OL>
	 * 
	 * The new model has one important property above the previous one: it only
	 * distorts the other half-wave, the same which can be seen distorted in SID
	 * samplings, too. Therefore it makes for more complicated distorted sounds,
	 * and better replicates the effects in f.e. Mechanicus.
	 * <LI> 5.12.2007 Nearly doubled the impact of the bp-hp term. This improves
	 * Elite and Shades quite a bit, without seeming to negatively impact other
	 * songs.
	 * <LI> 4.12.2007 Made tunables out of the rest of the distortion
	 * parameters, save from one that I just added: low-pass filtering for my
	 * crude w0_eff term. This seems to reduce the artifacts on Robocop 3, and
	 * generally doesn't seem to harm the songs.
	 * <LI> 3.12.2007 A new distortion algorithm. A lot of time has passed. I
	 * made some improvements that force more distortion out of the model. I
	 * feel that this reinstates some of my LEADDIST effects and should be
	 * closer to correct model. I'm reasonably happy about how it turned out.
	 * This is definitely the best all-around emulation to date.
	 * 
	 * I also made the distortion tunable via config file, so the thing is sane
	 * and doesn't trash 8580 any more.
	 * <LI> 18.4.2007 Oops, a few months passed as I was busy at work.
	 * 
	 * I've got rid of the LEADDIST effect, simply accepted that things will not
	 * work with it. I hope to be able to replace it with another trick up my
	 * sleeve, but so far the new songs and patch probably constitute a step
	 * backwards. Maybe.
	 * <LI> 13.2.2007 Defeat with the masterful TBB songs such as 0_N_0 and
	 * Meanwhile The Planet. The 0_N_0 makes a lot of snapping because in a real
	 * chip the distortion terms are "filtered" by the other filter components,
	 * while mine are filtered by a static ad-hoc estimate. So, the snapping
	 * here comes from the LEADDIST term and it doesn't make the right kind of
	 * effect.
	 * 
	 * Meanwhile The Planet makes masterfully precise use of the filter, and
	 * there isn't enough distortion for ReSID rendition to be palatable. Thanks
	 * to Grue for digging these songs up. Also fixed invalid sidplay2.ini
	 * configuration file (was not using 6581R4 curve). This, too, was spotted
	 * by Grue.
	 * 
	 * I suspect Snake Disco might be fixed by accounting for the loss of
	 * intensity of sound with the Vbp op-amp distortion. I made some
	 * measurements last night and discovered that level of lp and hp outputs
	 * dropped dramatically when bp was driven to distortion. I observed loss of
	 * up to 20 dB. I probably have to make many more measurements to allow
	 * mapping an estimate for this behaviour.
	 * <LI> 12.2.2007 I added a minor tweak, adding an estimate of the resonance
	 * term in the op-amp loading measurement. I also made the bass distortion
	 * slightly more prominent, although it still isn't so harsh as the real
	 * chip produces.
	 * <LI> 11.2.2007 I decided the price for fixing RoboCop 3 on 10.2. changes
	 * was too high to pay. It put a few dB of distortion back and migrated the
	 * distortion back to later time. Other changes in frequency drift
	 * implementation however helped a lot even with RoboCop 3, although I do
	 * think it still distorts too much. I think overall I'm now better off.
	 * 
	 * I also moved the distortion term computation into the filter clocking
	 * function, so that if output is being requested at some different rate
	 * than the filter is clocked, the lowpass filtering would still be computed
	 * similarly. This bit me because I had this stupid OptimiseLevel
	 * PerformanceHacks accidentally enabled.
	 * <LI> 10.2.2007 I made the distortion term to start earlier but also more
	 * delicate. (Reduced distortion by 6 dB.) This fixed RoboCop_3, SYS4096 and
	 * improved locutox's cover of Purple Shades. (Not included on sample set.)
	 * I also set bass level to -4.4 dB, because it comes about 1.5 dB louder
	 * than treble or bandpass. This is in full contrast to comments in ReSID
	 * that claim no level difference exists. Strange, but I can see it plain as
	 * day on FFT.
	 * <LI> 3.2.2007 - 9.2.2007 Creation and tuning the model...

	 * sample generation. The samples are generated by resampling to the
	 * specified sampling frequency. The work rate is inversely proportional to
	 * the percentage of the bandwidth allocated to the filter transition band.
	 * <P>
	 * This implementation is based on the paper "A Flexible Sampling-Rate

	 * http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/
	 * <P>
	 * By building shifted FIR tables with samples according to the sampling
	 * frequency, this implementation dramatically reduces the computational
	 * effort in the filter convolutions, without any loss of accuracy. The
	 * filter convolutions are also vectorizable on current hardware.
	 * <P>
	 * Further possible optimizations are: * An equiripple filter design could
	 * yield a lower filter order, see
	 * http://www.mwrf.com/Articles/ArticleID/7229/7229.html * The Convolution
	 * Theorem could be used to bring the complexity of convolution down from
	 * O(n*n) to O(n*log(n)) using the Fast Fourier Transform, see
	 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem * Simply resampling in
	 * two steps can also yield computational savings, since the transition band
	 * will be wider in the first step and the required filter order is thus
	 * lower in this step. Laurent Ganier has found the optimal intermediate
	 * sampling frequency to be (via derivation of sum of two steps): 2 *
